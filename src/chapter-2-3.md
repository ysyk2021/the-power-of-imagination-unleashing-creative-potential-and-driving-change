This imaginative approach significantly reduced the cost of space missions and made space travel more economically viable.

**Impact:** By harnessing imagination and pushing the boundaries of space technology, SpaceX has achieved numerous milestones. They successfully landed reusable rockets, launched resupply missions to the International Space Station, and secured contracts for future crewed missions.
